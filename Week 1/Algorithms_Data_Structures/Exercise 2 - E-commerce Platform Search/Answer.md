# 1.Understand Asymptotic Notation:

## Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms
- Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's time or space complexity in terms of the size of the input.
- It helps in comparing the efficiency of algorithms, especially as the input size grows.

## Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.
- Linear Search: Best case O(1) (if the target is at the first index), average and worst case O(n).
- Binary Search: Best case O(1) (if the middle element is the target), average and worst case O(log n), assuming the array is sorted.


# 4.Analysis:

## Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.
- Linear Search: Simple and does not require sorted data but is slower (O(n)) for large datasets.
- Binary Search: Much faster (O(log n)) for large datasets but requires the data to be sorted.

## Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.
- Binary search is generally preferred if the dataset can be maintained in a sorted order, as it provides much faster search times for large collections of products.
