# 1.Understand Search Algorithms:
### Explain linear search and binary search algorithms.
- The linear search algorithm is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found; otherwise, the search continues till the end of the dataset.

# 4.Analysis:

### Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search.
- Linear Search: O(n) time complexity, does not require data to be sorted, simple to implement.
- Binary Search: O(log n) time complexity, requires the data to be sorted, more efficient for large datasets.
### Discuss when to use each algorithm based on the data set size and order.
- Linear Search: Suitable for small datasets or when the data is unsorted.
- Binary Search: Preferred for large datasets with sorted data due to its faster search time.
